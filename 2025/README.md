<summary>--- Day 1: Secret Entrance ---</summary>

    The Elves have good news and bad news.
    
    The good news is that they've discovered project management! This has given them the tools they need to prevent their usual Christmas emergency. For example, they now know that the North Pole decorations need to be finished soon so that other critical tasks can start on time.
    
    The bad news is that they've realized they have a different emergency: according to their resource planning, none of them have any time left to decorate the North Pole!
    
    To save Christmas, the Elves need you to finish decorating the North Pole by December 12th.
    
    Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!
    
    You arrive at the secret entrance to the North Pole base ready to start decorating. Unfortunately, the password seems to have been changed, so you can't get in. A document taped to the wall helpfully explains:
    
    "Due to new security protocols, the password is locked in the safe below. Please see the attached document for the new combination."
    
    The safe has a dial with only an arrow on it; around the dial are the numbers 0 through 99 in order. As you turn the dial, it makes a small click noise as it reaches each number.
    
    The attached document (your puzzle input) contains a sequence of rotations, one per line, which tell you how to open the safe. A rotation starts with an L or R which indicates whether the rotation should be to the left (toward lower numbers) or to the right (toward higher numbers). Then, the rotation has a distance value which indicates how many clicks the dial should be rotated in that direction.
    
    So, if the dial were pointing at 11, a rotation of R8 would cause the dial to point at 19. After that, a rotation of L19 would cause it to point at 0.
    
    Because the dial is a circle, turning the dial left from 0 one click makes it point at 99. Similarly, turning the dial right from 99 one click makes it point at 0.
    
    So, if the dial were pointing at 5, a rotation of L10 would cause it to point at 95. After that, a rotation of R5 could cause it to point at 0.
    
    The dial starts by pointing at 50.
    
    You could follow the instructions, but your recent required official North Pole secret entrance security training seminar taught you that the safe is actually a decoy. The actual password is the number of times the dial is left pointing at 0 after any rotation in the sequence.
    
    For example, suppose the attached document contained the following rotations:
    
    L68
    L30
    R48
    L5
    R60
    L55
    L1
    L99
    R14
    L82
    Following these rotations would cause the dial to move as follows:
    
    The dial starts by pointing at 50.
    The dial is rotated L68 to point at 82.
    The dial is rotated L30 to point at 52.
    The dial is rotated R48 to point at 0.
    The dial is rotated L5 to point at 95.
    The dial is rotated R60 to point at 55.
    The dial is rotated L55 to point at 0.
    The dial is rotated L1 to point at 99.
    The dial is rotated L99 to point at 0.
    The dial is rotated R14 to point at 14.
    The dial is rotated L82 to point at 32.
    Because the dial points at 0 a total of three times during this process, the password in this example is 3.
    
    Analyze the rotations in your attached document. What's the actual password to open the door?
    
    Your puzzle answer was 1081.
    
    --- Part Two ---
    You're sure that's the right password, but the door won't open. You knock, but nobody answers. You build a snowman while you think.
    
    As you're rolling the snowballs for your snowman, you find another security document that must have fallen into the snow:
    
    "Due to newer security protocols, please use password method 0x434C49434B until further notice."
    
    You remember from the training seminar that "method 0x434C49434B" means you're actually supposed to count the number of times any click causes the dial to point at 0, regardless of whether it happens during a rotation or at the end of one.
    
    Following the same rotations as in the above example, the dial points at zero a few extra times during its rotations:
    
    The dial starts by pointing at 50.
    The dial is rotated L68 to point at 82; during this rotation, it points at 0 once.
    The dial is rotated L30 to point at 52.
    The dial is rotated R48 to point at 0.
    The dial is rotated L5 to point at 95.
    The dial is rotated R60 to point at 55; during this rotation, it points at 0 once.
    The dial is rotated L55 to point at 0.
    The dial is rotated L1 to point at 99.
    The dial is rotated L99 to point at 0.
    The dial is rotated R14 to point at 14.
    The dial is rotated L82 to point at 32; during this rotation, it points at 0 once.
    In this example, the dial points at 0 three times at the end of a rotation, plus three more times during a rotation. So, in this example, the new password would be 6.
    
    Be careful: if the dial were pointing at 50, a single rotation like R1000 would cause the dial to point at 0 ten times before returning back to 50!
    
    Using password method 0x434C49434B, what is the password to open the door?

<summary>--- Day 2: Gift Shop ---</summary>
You get inside and take the elevator to its only other stop: the gift shop. "Thank you for visiting the North Pole!" gleefully exclaims a nearby sign. You aren't sure who is even allowed to visit the North Pole, but you know you can access the lobby through here, and from there you can access the rest of the North Pole base.

As you make your way through the surprisingly extensive selection, one of the clerks recognizes you and asks for your help.

As it turns out, one of the younger Elves was playing on a gift shop computer and managed to add a whole bunch of invalid product IDs to their gift shop database! Surely, it would be no trouble for you to identify the invalid product IDs for them, right?

They've even checked most of the product ID ranges already; they only have a few product ID ranges (your puzzle input) that you'll need to check. For example:

11-22,95-115,998-1012,1188511880-1188511890,222220-222224,
1698522-1698528,446443-446449,38593856-38593862,565653-565659,
824824821-824824827,2121212118-2121212124
(The ID ranges are wrapped here for legibility; in your input, they appear on a single long line.)

The ranges are separated by commas (,); each range gives its first ID and last ID separated by a dash (-).

Since the young Elf was just doing silly patterns, you can find the invalid IDs by looking for any ID which is made only of some sequence of digits repeated twice. So, 55 (5 twice), 6464 (64 twice), and 123123 (123 twice) would all be invalid IDs.

None of the numbers have leading zeroes; 0101 isn't an ID at all. (101 is a valid ID that you would ignore.)

Your job is to find all of the invalid IDs that appear in the given ranges. In the above example:

11-22 has two invalid IDs, 11 and 22.
95-115 has one invalid ID, 99.
998-1012 has one invalid ID, 1010.
1188511880-1188511890 has one invalid ID, 1188511885.
222220-222224 has one invalid ID, 222222.
1698522-1698528 contains no invalid IDs.
446443-446449 has one invalid ID, 446446.
38593856-38593862 has one invalid ID, 38593859.
The rest of the ranges contain no invalid IDs.
Adding up all the invalid IDs in this example produces 1227775554.

What do you get if you add up all of the invalid IDs?

Your puzzle answer was 29818212493.

The first half of this puzzle is complete! It provides one gold star: *

--- Part Two ---
The clerk quickly discovers that there are still invalid IDs in the ranges in your list. Maybe the young Elf was doing other silly patterns as well?

Now, an ID is invalid if it is made only of some sequence of digits repeated at least twice. So, 12341234 (1234 two times), 123123123 (123 three times), 1212121212 (12 five times), and 1111111 (1 seven times) are all invalid IDs.

From the same example as before:

11-22 still has two invalid IDs, 11 and 22.
95-115 now has two invalid IDs, 99 and 111.
998-1012 now has two invalid IDs, 999 and 1010.
1188511880-1188511890 still has one invalid ID, 1188511885.
222220-222224 still has one invalid ID, 222222.
1698522-1698528 still contains no invalid IDs.
446443-446449 still has one invalid ID, 446446.
38593856-38593862 still has one invalid ID, 38593859.
565653-565659 now has one invalid ID, 565656.
824824821-824824827 now has one invalid ID, 824824824.
2121212118-2121212124 now has one invalid ID, 2121212121.
Adding up all the invalid IDs in this example produces 4174379265.

What do you get if you add up all of the invalid IDs using these new rules?

<summary>--- Day 3: Lobby ---</summary>
You descend a short staircase, enter the surprisingly vast lobby, and are quickly cleared by the security checkpoint. When you get to the main elevators, however, you discover that each one has a red light above it: they're all offline.

"Sorry about that," an Elf apologizes as she tinkers with a nearby control panel. "Some kind of electrical surge seems to have fried them. I'll try to get them online soon."

You explain your need to get further underground. "Well, you could at least take the escalator down to the printing department, not that you'd get much further than that without the elevators working. That is, you could if the escalator weren't also offline."

"But, don't worry! It's not fried; it just needs power. Maybe you can get it running while I keep working on the elevators."

There are batteries nearby that can supply emergency power to the escalator for just such an occasion. The batteries are each labeled with their joltage rating, a value from 1 to 9. You make a note of their joltage ratings (your puzzle input). For example:

987654321111111
811111111111119
234234234234278
818181911112111
The batteries are arranged into banks; each line of digits in your input corresponds to a single bank of batteries. Within each bank, you need to turn on exactly two batteries; the joltage that the bank produces is equal to the number formed by the digits on the batteries you've turned on. For example, if you have a bank like 12345 and you turn on batteries 2 and 4, the bank would produce 24 jolts. (You cannot rearrange batteries.)

You'll need to find the largest possible joltage each bank can produce. In the above example:

In 987654321111111, you can make the largest joltage possible, 98, by turning on the first two batteries.
In 811111111111119, you can make the largest joltage possible by turning on the batteries labeled 8 and 9, producing 89 jolts.
In 234234234234278, you can make 78 by turning on the last two batteries (marked 7 and 8).
In 818181911112111, the largest joltage you can produce is 92.
The total output joltage is the sum of the maximum joltage from each bank, so in this example, the total output joltage is 98 + 89 + 78 + 92 = 357.

There are many batteries in front of you. Find the maximum joltage possible from each bank; what is the total output joltage?

Your puzzle answer was 16887.

--- Part Two ---
The escalator doesn't move. The Elf explains that it probably needs more joltage to overcome the static friction of the system and hits the big red "joltage limit safety override" button. You lose count of the number of times she needs to confirm "yes, I'm sure" and decorate the lobby a bit while you wait.

Now, you need to make the largest joltage by turning on exactly twelve batteries within each bank.

The joltage output for the bank is still the number formed by the digits of the batteries you've turned on; the only difference is that now there will be 12 digits in each bank's joltage output instead of two.

Consider again the example from before:

987654321111111
811111111111119
234234234234278
818181911112111
Now, the joltages are much larger:

In 987654321111111, the largest joltage can be found by turning on everything except some 1s at the end to produce 987654321111.
In the digit sequence 811111111111119, the largest joltage can be found by turning on everything except some 1s, producing 811111111119.
In 234234234234278, the largest joltage can be found by turning on everything except a 2 battery, a 3 battery, and another 2 battery near the start to produce 434234234278.
In 818181911112111, the joltage 888911112111 is produced by turning on everything except some 1s near the front.
The total output joltage is now much larger: 987654321111 + 811111111119 + 434234234278 + 888911112111 = 3121910778619.

What is the new total output joltage?

Your puzzle answer was 167302518850275.

<summary>--- Day 4: Printing Department ---</summary>
You ride the escalator down to the printing department. They're clearly getting ready for Christmas; they have lots of large rolls of paper everywhere, and there's even a massive printer in the corner (to handle the really big print jobs).

Decorating here will be easy: they can make their own decorations. What you really need is a way to get further into the North Pole base while the elevators are offline.

"Actually, maybe we can help with that," one of the Elves replies when you ask for help. "We're pretty sure there's a cafeteria on the other side of the back wall. If we could break through the wall, you'd be able to keep moving. It's too bad all of our forklifts are so busy moving those big rolls of paper around."

If you can optimize the work the forklifts are doing, maybe they would have time to spare to break through the wall.

The rolls of paper (@) are arranged on a large grid; the Elves even have a helpful diagram (your puzzle input) indicating where everything is located.

For example:

..@@.@@@@.
@@@.@.@.@@
@@@@@.@.@@
@.@@@@..@.
@@.@@@@.@@
.@@@@@@@.@
.@.@.@.@@@
@.@@@.@@@@
.@@@@@@@@.
@.@.@@@.@.
The forklifts can only access a roll of paper if there are fewer than four rolls of paper in the eight adjacent positions. If you can figure out which rolls of paper the forklifts can access, they'll spend less time looking and more time breaking down the wall to the cafeteria.

In this example, there are 13 rolls of paper that can be accessed by a forklift (marked with x):

..xx.xx@x.
x@@.@.@.@@
@@@@@.x.@@
@.@@@@..@.
x@.@@@@.@x
.@@@@@@@.@
.@.@.@.@@@
x.@@@.@@@@
.@@@@@@@@.
x.x.@@@.x.
Consider your complete diagram of the paper roll locations. How many rolls of paper can be accessed by a forklift?

Your puzzle answer was 1564.

--- Part Two ---
Now, the Elves just need help accessing as much of the paper as they can.

Once a roll of paper can be accessed by a forklift, it can be removed. Once a roll of paper is removed, the forklifts might be able to access more rolls of paper, which they might also be able to remove. How many total rolls of paper could the Elves remove if they keep repeating this process?

Starting with the same example as above, here is one way you could remove as many rolls of paper as possible, using highlighted @ to indicate that a roll of paper is about to be removed, and using x to indicate that a roll of paper was just removed:

Initial state:
..@@.@@@@.
@@@.@.@.@@
@@@@@.@.@@
@.@@@@..@.
@@.@@@@.@@
.@@@@@@@.@
.@.@.@.@@@
@.@@@.@@@@

Remove 13 rolls of paper:

Stop once no more rolls of paper are accessible by a forklift. In this example, a total of 43 rolls of paper can be removed.

Start with your original diagram. How many rolls of paper in total can be removed by the Elves and their forklifts?

Your puzzle answer was 9401.

<summary>--- Day 5: Cafeteria ---</summary>
As the forklifts break through the wall, the Elves are delighted to discover that there was a cafeteria on the other side after all.

You can hear a commotion coming from the kitchen. "At this rate, we won't have any time left to put the wreaths up in the dining hall!" Resolute in your quest, you investigate.

"If only we hadn't switched to the new inventory management system right before Christmas!" another Elf exclaims. You ask what's going on.

The Elves in the kitchen explain the situation: because of their complicated new inventory management system, they can't figure out which of their ingredients are fresh and which are spoiled. When you ask how it works, they give you a copy of their database (your puzzle input).

The database operates on ingredient IDs. It consists of a list of fresh ingredient ID ranges, a blank line, and a list of available ingredient IDs. For example:

3-5
10-14
16-20
12-18

1
5
8
11
17
32
The fresh ID ranges are inclusive: the range 3-5 means that ingredient IDs 3, 4, and 5 are all fresh. The ranges can also overlap; an ingredient ID is fresh if it is in any range.

The Elves are trying to determine which of the available ingredient IDs are fresh. In this example, this is done as follows:

Ingredient ID 1 is spoiled because it does not fall into any range.
Ingredient ID 5 is fresh because it falls into range 3-5.
Ingredient ID 8 is spoiled.
Ingredient ID 11 is fresh because it falls into range 10-14.
Ingredient ID 17 is fresh because it falls into range 16-20 as well as range 12-18.
Ingredient ID 32 is spoiled.
So, in this example, 3 of the available ingredient IDs are fresh.

Process the database file from the new inventory management system. How many of the available ingredient IDs are fresh?

Your puzzle answer was 707.

--- Part Two ---
The Elves start bringing their spoiled inventory to the trash chute at the back of the kitchen.

So that they can stop bugging you when they get new inventory, the Elves would like to know all of the IDs that the fresh ingredient ID ranges consider to be fresh. An ingredient ID is still considered fresh if it is in any range.

Now, the second section of the database (the available ingredient IDs) is irrelevant. Here are the fresh ingredient ID ranges from the above example:

3-5
10-14
16-20
12-18
The ingredient IDs that these ranges consider to be fresh are 3, 4, 5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20. So, in this example, the fresh ingredient ID ranges consider a total of 14 ingredient IDs to be fresh.

Process the database file again. How many ingredient IDs are considered to be fresh according to the fresh ingredient ID ranges?

Your puzzle answer was 361615643045059.

<summary>--- Day 6: Trash Compactor ---</summary>
After helping the Elves in the kitchen, you were taking a break and helping them re-enact a movie scene when you over-enthusiastically jumped into the garbage chute!

A brief fall later, you find yourself in a garbage smasher. Unfortunately, the door's been magnetically sealed.

As you try to find a way out, you are approached by a family of cephalopods! They're pretty sure they can get the door open, but it will take some time. While you wait, they're curious if you can help the youngest cephalopod with her math homework.

Cephalopod math doesn't look that different from normal math. The math worksheet (your puzzle input) consists of a list of problems; each problem has a group of numbers that need to be either added (+) or multiplied (*) together.

However, the problems are arranged a little strangely; they seem to be presented next to each other in a very long horizontal list. For example:

123 328  51 64 
 45 64  387 23 
  6 98  215 314
*   +   *   +  
Each problem's numbers are arranged vertically; at the bottom of the problem is the symbol for the operation that needs to be performed. Problems are separated by a full column of only spaces. The left/right alignment of numbers within each problem can be ignored.

So, this worksheet contains four problems:

123 * 45 * 6 = 33210
328 + 64 + 98 = 490
51 * 387 * 215 = 4243455
64 + 23 + 314 = 401
To check their work, cephalopod students are given the grand total of adding together all of the answers to the individual problems. In this worksheet, the grand total is 33210 + 490 + 4243455 + 401 = 4277556.

Of course, the actual worksheet is much wider. You'll need to make sure to unroll it completely so that you can read the problems clearly.

Solve the problems on the math worksheet. What is the grand total found by adding together all of the answers to the individual problems?

Your puzzle answer was 5322004718681.

--- Part Two ---
The big cephalopods come back to check on how things are going. When they see that your grand total doesn't match the one expected by the worksheet, they realize they forgot to explain how to read cephalopod math.

Cephalopod math is written right-to-left in columns. Each number is given in its own column, with the most significant digit at the top and the least significant digit at the bottom. (Problems are still separated with a column consisting only of spaces, and the symbol at the bottom of the problem is still the operator to use.)

Here's the example worksheet again:

123 328  51 64 
 45 64  387 23 
  6 98  215 314
*   +   *   +  
Reading the problems right-to-left one column at a time, the problems are now quite different:

The rightmost problem is 4 + 431 + 623 = 1058
The second problem from the right is 175 * 581 * 32 = 3253600
The third problem from the right is 8 + 248 + 369 = 625
Finally, the leftmost problem is 356 * 24 * 1 = 8544
Now, the grand total is 1058 + 3253600 + 625 + 8544 = 3263827.

Solve the problems on the math worksheet again. What is the grand total found by adding together all of the answers to the individual problems?

Your puzzle answer was 9876636978528.

<summary> --- Day 7: Laboratories --- </summary>
You thank the cephalopods for the help and exit the trash compactor, finding yourself in the familiar halls of a North Pole research wing.

Based on the large sign that says "teleporter hub", they seem to be researching teleportation; you can't help but try it for yourself and step onto the large yellow teleporter pad.

Suddenly, you find yourself in an unfamiliar room! The room has no doors; the only way out is the teleporter. Unfortunately, the teleporter seems to be leaking magic smoke.

Since this is a teleporter lab, there are lots of spare parts, manuals, and diagnostic equipment lying around. After connecting one of the diagnostic tools, it helpfully displays error code 0H-N0, which apparently means that there's an issue with one of the tachyon manifolds.

You quickly locate a diagram of the tachyon manifold (your puzzle input). A tachyon beam enters the manifold at the location marked S; tachyon beams always move downward. Tachyon beams pass freely through empty space (.). However, if a tachyon beam encounters a splitter (^), the beam is stopped; instead, a new tachyon beam continues from the immediate left and from the immediate right of the splitter.

For example:

.......S.......
...............
.......^.......
...............
......^.^......
...............
.....^.^.^.....
...............
....^.^...^....
...............
...^.^...^.^...
...............
..^...^.....^..
...............
.^.^.^.^.^...^.

In this example, the incoming tachyon beam (|) extends downward from S until it reaches the first splitter:

.......S.......
.......|.......

At that point, the original beam stops, and two new beams are emitted from the splitter:

.......S.......
.......|.......
......|^|......
...............
......^.^......
...............
.....^.^.^.....
...............
....^.^...^....
...............
...^.^...^.^...
...............
..^...^.....^..
...............
.^.^.^.^.^...^.
...............
Those beams continue downward until they reach more splitters:

.......S.......
.......|.......
......|^|......
......|.|......
......^.^......
...............
.....^.^.^.....
...............
....^.^...^....
...............
...^.^...^.^...
...............
..^...^.....^..
...............
.^.^.^.^.^...^.
...............
At this point, the two splitters create a total of only three tachyon beams, since they are both dumping tachyons into the same place between them:

.......S.......
.......|.......
......|^|......
......|.|......
.....|^|^|.....
...............
.....^.^.^.....
...............
....^.^...^....
...............
...^.^...^.^...
...............
..^...^.....^..
...............
.^.^.^.^.^...^.
...............
This process continues until all of the tachyon beams reach a splitter or exit the manifold:

.......S.......
.......|.......
......|^|......
......|.|......
.....|^|^|.....
.....|.|.|.....
....|^|^|^|....
....|.|.|.|....

|.|.|.|.|.|||.|
To repair the teleporter, you first need to understand the beam-splitting properties of the tachyon manifold. In this example, a tachyon beam is split a total of 21 times.

Analyze your manifold diagram. How many times will the beam be split?

Your puzzle answer was 1630.

--- Part Two ---
With your analysis of the manifold complete, you begin fixing the teleporter. However, as you open the side of the teleporter to replace the broken manifold, you are surprised to discover that it isn't a classical tachyon manifold - it's a quantum tachyon manifold.

With a quantum tachyon manifold, only a single tachyon particle is sent through the manifold. A tachyon particle takes both the left and right path of each splitter encountered.

Since this is impossible, the manual recommends the many-worlds interpretation of quantum tachyon splitting: each time a particle reaches a splitter, it's actually time itself which splits. In one timeline, the particle went left, and in the other timeline, the particle went right.

To fix the manifold, what you really need to know is the number of timelines active after a single particle completes all of its possible journeys through the manifold.

In the above example, there are many timelines. For instance, there's the timeline where the particle always went left:

.......S.......
.......|.......
......|^.......
......|........
.....|^.^......
.....|.........
....|^.^.^.....
....|..........
...|^.^...^....
...|...........
..|^.^...^.^...
..|............
.|^...^.....^..
.|.............
|^.^.^.^.^...^.
|..............
Or, there's the timeline where the particle alternated going left and right at each splitter:

.......S.......
.......|.......
......|^.......
......|........
......^|^......
.......|.......
.....^|^.^.....
......|........
....^.^|..^....
.......|.......
...^.^.|.^.^...
.......|.......
..^...^|....^..
.......|.......
.^.^.^|^.^...^.
......|........
Or, there's the timeline where the particle ends up at the same point as the alternating timeline, but takes a totally different path to get there:

.......S.......
.......|.......
......|^.......
......|........
.....|^.^......
.....|.........
....|^.^.^.....
....|..........
....^|^...^....
.....|.........
...^.^|..^.^...
......|........
..^..|^.....^..
.....|.........
.^.^.^|^.^...^.
......|........
In this example, in total, the particle ends up on 40 different timelines.

Apply the many-worlds interpretation of quantum tachyon splitting to your manifold diagram. In total, how many different timelines would a single tachyon particle end up on?

<summary> --- Day 8: Playground --- </summary
Equipped with a new understanding of teleporter maintenance, you confidently step onto the repaired teleporter pad.

You rematerialize on an unfamiliar teleporter pad and find yourself in a vast underground space which contains a giant playground!

Across the playground, a group of Elves are working on setting up an ambitious Christmas decoration project. Through careful rigging, they have suspended a large number of small electrical junction boxes.

Their plan is to connect the junction boxes with long strings of lights. Most of the junction boxes don't provide electricity; however, when two junction boxes are connected by a string of lights, electricity can pass between those two junction boxes.

The Elves are trying to figure out which junction boxes to connect so that electricity can reach every junction box. They even have a list of all of the junction boxes' positions in 3D space (your puzzle input).

For example:

162,817,812
57,618,57
906,360,560
592,479,940
352,342,300
466,668,158
542,29,236
431,825,988
739,650,466
52,470,668
216,146,977
819,987,18
117,168,530
805,96,715
346,949,466
970,615,88
941,993,340
862,61,35
984,92,344
425,690,689
This list describes the position of 20 junction boxes, one per line. Each position is given as X,Y,Z coordinates. So, the first junction box in the list is at X=162, Y=817, Z=812.

To save on string lights, the Elves would like to focus on connecting pairs of junction boxes that are as close together as possible according to straight-line distance. In this example, the two junction boxes which are closest together are 162,817,812 and 425,690,689.

By connecting these two junction boxes together, because electricity can flow between them, they become part of the same circuit. After connecting them, there is a single circuit which contains two junction boxes, and the remaining 18 junction boxes remain in their own individual circuits.

Now, the two junction boxes which are closest together but aren't already directly connected are 162,817,812 and 431,825,988. After connecting them, since 162,817,812 is already connected to another junction box, there is now a single circuit which contains three junction boxes and an additional 17 circuits which contain one junction box each.

The next two junction boxes to connect are 906,360,560 and 805,96,715. After connecting them, there is a circuit containing 3 junction boxes, a circuit containing 2 junction boxes, and 15 circuits which contain one junction box each.

The next two junction boxes are 431,825,988 and 425,690,689. Because these two junction boxes were already in the same circuit, nothing happens!

This process continues for a while, and the Elves are concerned that they don't have enough extension cables for all these circuits. They would like to know how big the circuits will be.

After making the ten shortest connections, there are 11 circuits: one circuit which contains 5 junction boxes, one circuit which contains 4 junction boxes, two circuits which contain 2 junction boxes each, and seven circuits which each contain a single junction box. Multiplying together the sizes of the three largest circuits (5, 4, and one of the circuits of size 2) produces 40.

Your list contains many junction boxes; connect together the 1000 pairs of junction boxes which are closest together. Afterward, what do you get if you multiply together the sizes of the three largest circuits?

<summary> --- Day 9: Movie Theater --- </summary>
You slide down the firepole in the corner of the playground and land in the North Pole base movie theater!

The movie theater has a big tile floor with an interesting pattern. Elves here are redecorating the theater by switching out some of the square tiles in the big grid they form. Some of the tiles are red; the Elves would like to find the largest rectangle that uses red tiles for two of its opposite corners. They even have a list of where the red tiles are located in the grid (your puzzle input).

For example:

7,1
11,1
11,7
9,7
9,5
2,5
2,3
7,3
Showing red tiles as # and other tiles as ., the above arrangement of red tiles would look like this:

..............
.......#...#..
..............
..#....#......
..............
..#......#....
..............
.........#.#..
..............
You can choose any two red tiles as the opposite corners of your rectangle; your goal is to find the largest rectangle possible.

For example, you could make a rectangle (shown as O) with an area of 24 between 2,5 and 9,7:

..............
.......#...#..
..............
..#....#......
..............
..OOOOOOOO....
..OOOOOOOO....
..OOOOOOOO.#..
..............
Or, you could make a rectangle with area 35 between 7,1 and 11,7:

..............
.......OOOOO..
.......OOOOO..
..#....OOOOO..
.......OOOOO..
..#....OOOOO..
.......OOOOO..
.......OOOOO..
..............
You could even make a thin rectangle with an area of only 6 between 7,3 and 2,3:

..............
.......#...#..
..............
..OOOOOO......
..............
..#......#....
..............
.........#.#..
..............
Ultimately, the largest rectangle you can make in this example has area 50. One way to do this is between 2,5 and 11,1:

..............
..OOOOOOOOOO..
..OOOOOOOOOO..
..OOOOOOOOOO..
..OOOOOOOOOO..
..OOOOOOOOOO..
..............
.........#.#..
..............
Using two red tiles as opposite corners, what is the largest area of any rectangle you can make?

Your puzzle answer was 4759531084.

The first half of this puzzle is complete! It provides one gold star: *

--- Part Two ---
The Elves just remembered: they can only switch out tiles that are red or green. So, your rectangle can only include red or green tiles.

In your list, every red tile is connected to the red tile before and after it by a straight line of green tiles. The list wraps, so the first red tile is also connected to the last red tile. Tiles that are adjacent in your list will always be on either the same row or the same column.

Using the same example as before, the tiles marked X would be green:

..............
.......#XXX#..
.......X...X..
..#XXXX#...X..
..X........X..
..#XXXXXX#.X..
.........X.X..
.........#X#..
..............
In addition, all of the tiles inside this loop of red and green tiles are also green. So, in this example, these are the green tiles:

..............
.......#XXX#..
.......XXXXX..
..#XXXX#XXXX..
..XXXXXXXXXX..
..#XXXXXX#XX..
.........XXX..
.........#X#..
..............
The remaining tiles are never red nor green.

The rectangle you choose still must have red tiles in opposite corners, but any other tiles it includes must now be red or green. This significantly limits your options.

For example, you could make a rectangle out of red and green tiles with an area of 15 between 7,3 and 11,1:

..............
.......OOOOO..
.......OOOOO..
..#XXXXOOOOO..
..XXXXXXXXXX..
..#XXXXXX#XX..
.........XXX..
.........#X#..
..............
Or, you could make a thin rectangle with an area of 3 between 9,7 and 9,5:

..............
.......#XXX#..
.......XXXXX..
..#XXXX#XXXX..
..XXXXXXXXXX..
..#XXXXXXOXX..
.........OXX..
.........OX#..
..............
The largest rectangle you can make in this example using only red and green tiles has area 24. One way to do this is between 9,5 and 2,3:

..............
.......#XXX#..
.......XXXXX..
..OOOOOOOOXX..
..OOOOOOOOXX..
..OOOOOOOOXX..
.........XXX..
.........#X#..
..............
Using two red tiles as opposite corners, what is the largest area of any rectangle you can make using only red and green tiles?

<summary>--- Day 10: Factory ---</summary>
Just across the hall, you find a large factory. Fortunately, the Elves here have plenty of time to decorate. Unfortunately, it's because the factory machines are all offline, and none of the Elves can figure out the initialization procedure.

The Elves do have the manual for the machines, but the section detailing the initialization procedure was eaten by a Shiba Inu. All that remains of the manual are some indicator light diagrams, button wiring schematics, and joltage requirements for each machine.

For example:

[.##.] (3) (1,3) (2) (2,3) (0,2) (0,1) {3,5,4,7}
[...#.] (0,2,3,4) (2,3) (0,4) (0,1,2) (1,2,3,4) {7,5,12,7,2}
[.###.#] (0,1,2,3,4) (0,3,4) (0,1,2,4,5) (1,2) {10,11,11,5,10,5}
The manual describes one machine per line. Each line contains a single indicator light diagram in [square brackets], one or more button wiring schematics in (parentheses), and joltage requirements in {curly braces}.

To start a machine, its indicator lights must match those shown in the diagram, where . means off and # means on. The machine has the number of indicator lights shown, but its indicator lights are all initially off.

So, an indicator light diagram like [.##.] means that the machine has four indicator lights which are initially off and that the goal is to simultaneously configure the first light to be off, the second light to be on, the third to be on, and the fourth to be off.

You can toggle the state of indicator lights by pushing any of the listed buttons. Each button lists which indicator lights it toggles, where 0 means the first light, 1 means the second light, and so on. When you push a button, each listed indicator light either turns on (if it was off) or turns off (if it was on). You have to push each button an integer number of times; there's no such thing as "0.5 presses" (nor can you push a button a negative number of times).

So, a button wiring schematic like (0,3,4) means that each time you push that button, the first, fourth, and fifth indicator lights would all toggle between on and off. If the indicator lights were [#.....], pushing the button would change them to be [...##.] instead.

Because none of the machines are running, the joltage requirements are irrelevant and can be safely ignored.

You can push each button as many times as you like. However, to save on time, you will need to determine the fewest total presses required to correctly configure all indicator lights for all machines in your list.

There are a few ways to correctly configure the first machine:

[.##.] (3) (1,3) (2) (2,3) (0,2) (0,1) {3,5,4,7}
You could press the first three buttons once each, a total of 3 button presses.
You could press (1,3) once, (2,3) once, and (0,1) twice, a total of 4 button presses.
You could press all of the buttons except (1,3) once each, a total of 5 button presses.
However, the fewest button presses required is 2. One way to do this is by pressing the last two buttons ((0,2) and (0,1)) once each.

The second machine can be configured with as few as 3 button presses:

[...#.] (0,2,3,4) (2,3) (0,4) (0,1,2) (1,2,3,4) {7,5,12,7,2}
One way to achieve this is by pressing the last three buttons ((0,4), (0,1,2), and (1,2,3,4)) once each.

The third machine has a total of six indicator lights that need to be configured correctly:

[.###.#] (0,1,2,3,4) (0,3,4) (0,1,2,4,5) (1,2) {10,11,11,5,10,5}
The fewest presses required to correctly configure it is 2; one way to do this is by pressing buttons (0,3,4) and (0,1,2,4,5) once each.

So, the fewest button presses required to correctly configure the indicator lights on all of the machines is 2 + 3 + 2 = 7.

Analyze each machine's indicator light diagram and button wiring schematics. What is the fewest button presses required to correctly configure the indicator lights on all of the machines?

<summary>--- Day 11: Reactor ---</summary>


You hear some loud beeping coming from a hatch in the floor of the factory, so you decide to check it out. Inside, you find several large electrical conduits and a ladder.

Climbing down the ladder, you discover the source of the beeping: a large, toroidal reactor which powers the factory above. Some Elves here are hurriedly running between the reactor and a nearby server rack, apparently trying to fix something.

One of the Elves notices you and rushes over. "It's a good thing you're here! We just installed a new server rack, but we aren't having any luck getting the reactor to communicate with it!" You glance around the room and see a tangle of cables and devices running from the server rack to the reactor. She rushes off, returning a moment later with a list of the devices and their outputs (your puzzle input).

For example:

aaa: you hhh
you: bbb ccc
bbb: ddd eee
ccc: ddd eee fff
ddd: ggg
eee: out
fff: out
ggg: out
hhh: ccc fff iii
iii: out
Each line gives the name of a device followed by a list of the devices to which its outputs are attached. So, bbb: ddd eee means that device bbb has two outputs, one leading to device ddd and the other leading to device eee.

The Elves are pretty sure that the issue isn't due to any specific device, but rather that the issue is triggered by data following some specific path through the devices. Data only ever flows from a device through its outputs; it can't flow backwards.

After dividing up the work, the Elves would like you to focus on the devices starting with the one next to you (an Elf hastily attaches a label which just says you) and ending with the main output to the reactor (which is the device with the label out).

To help the Elves figure out which path is causing the issue, they need you to find every path from you to out.

In this example, these are all of the paths from you to out:

Data could take the connection from you to bbb, then from bbb to ddd, then from ddd to ggg, then from ggg to out.
Data could take the connection to bbb, then to eee, then to out.
Data could go to ccc, then ddd, then ggg, then out.
Data could go to ccc, then eee, then out.
Data could go to ccc, then fff, then out.
In total, there are 5 different paths leading from you to out.

How many different paths lead from you to out?

<summary> --- Day 12: Christmas Tree Farm ---</summary>

You're almost out of time, but there can't be much left to decorate. Although there are no stairs, elevators, escalators, tunnels, chutes, teleporters, firepoles, or conduits here that would take you deeper into the North Pole base, there is a ventilation duct. You jump in.

After bumping around for a few minutes, you emerge into a large, well-lit cavern full of Christmas trees!

There are a few Elves here frantically decorating before the deadline. They think they'll be able to finish most of the work, but the one thing they're worried about is the presents for all the young Elves that live here at the North Pole. It's an ancient tradition to put the presents under the trees, but the Elves are worried they won't fit.

The presents come in a few standard but very weird shapes. The shapes and the regions into which they need to fit are all measured in standard units. To be aesthetically pleasing, the presents need to be placed into the regions in a way that follows a standardized two-dimensional unit grid; you also can't stack presents.

As always, the Elves have a summary of the situation (your puzzle input) for you. First, it contains a list of the presents' shapes. Second, it contains the size of the region under each tree and a list of the number of presents of each shape that need to fit into that region. For example:

0:
###
##.
##.

1:
###
##.
.##

2:
.##
###
##.

3:
##.
###
##.

4:
###
#..
###

5:
###
.#.
###

4x4: 0 0 0 0 2 0
12x5: 1 0 1 0 2 2
12x5: 1 0 1 0 3 2
The first section lists the standard present shapes. For convenience, each shape starts with its index and a colon; then, the shape is displayed visually, where # is part of the shape and . is not.

The second section lists the regions under the trees. Each line starts with the width and length of the region; 12x5 means the region is 12 units wide and 5 units long. The rest of the line describes the presents that need to fit into that region by listing the quantity of each shape of present; 1 0 1 0 3 2 means you need to fit one present with shape index 0, no presents with shape index 1, one present with shape index 2, no presents with shape index 3, three presents with shape index 4, and two presents with shape index 5.

Presents can be rotated and flipped as necessary to make them fit in the available space, but they have to always be placed perfectly on the grid. Shapes can't overlap (that is, the # part from two different presents can't go in the same place on the grid), but they can fit together (that is, the . part in a present's shape's diagram does not block another present from occupying that space on the grid).

The Elves need to know how many of the regions can fit the presents listed. In the above example, there are six unique present shapes and three regions that need checking.

The first region is 4x4:

....
....
....
....
In it, you need to determine whether you could fit two presents that have shape index 4:

###
#..
###
After some experimentation, it turns out that you can fit both presents in this region. Here is one way to do it, using A to represent one present and B to represent the other:

AAA.
ABAB
ABAB
.BBB
The second region, 12x5: 1 0 1 0 2 2, is 12 units wide and 5 units long. In that region, you need to try to fit one present with shape index 0, one present with shape index 2, two presents with shape index 4, and two presents with shape index 5.

It turns out that these presents can all fit in this region. Here is one way to do it, again using different capital letters to represent all the required presents:

....AAAFFE.E
.BBBAAFFFEEE
DDDBAAFFCECE
DBBB....CCC.
DDD.....C.C.
The third region, 12x5: 1 0 1 0 3 2, is the same size as the previous region; the only difference is that this region needs to fit one additional present with shape index 4. Unfortunately, no matter how hard you try, there is no way to fit all of the presents into this region.

So, in this example, 2 regions can fit all of their listed presents.

Consider the regions beneath each tree and the presents the Elves would like to fit into each of them. How many of the regions can fit all of the presents listed?
